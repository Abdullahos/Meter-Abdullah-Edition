Note that 
	we have to use spi0.x (for example: spidev0.0) for stpm33 as spi0.x can only select SPI_MODE_3 
	which is needed for stpm33 unlike spi1.x which can't apply SPI_MODE_3

/**************** Tampering ***************/
/*
Tampering Consist of 2 components LIMIT Switch and LED 
LIMIT Switch has 3 pins (please checkout to know the order of the pins in the Limit Switch 

pin is connected to the GND
pin is floating (not connected)
pin is connected to the SoC (check the pinout for RPI)

LED has 2 pins (anode & cathode)
don't forgeet to use 330-ohms resistor with LED 
Cathode pin is connected to GND 
Anode pin is connected to the SoC  (check the pinout for RPI)

Pinout for RPI:
